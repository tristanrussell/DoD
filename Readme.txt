Dungeons of Doom Instructions


SETUP:

To install the game, compile all the java files into Java byte code using the command line. Make sure to
keep all of these files together in one folder.

To run the game, run the Java byte code file you have just created called GameLogic.class.

The game will launch on the command line and ask you for a map file. You can type in a file location for
your map in the form C:\.....\yourMapFile.txt (your map does not need to be stored on the C drive, any
drive will do). If you do not have a map file to use you can just click Enter and the default map,
'Very Small Labyrinth of Doom', will be loaded. In the case that the map file location you specified
cannot be found, this default map will be loaded.
